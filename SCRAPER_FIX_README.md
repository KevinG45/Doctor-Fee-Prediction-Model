# Doctor Scraper Issue Fix

## Problem Statement
The scraper was only capturing ~900 doctors from Bangalore instead of the expected 4548+ doctors available on Practo.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the `practo_doctors_simple.py` spider which had several limitations:

1. **Artificial 20-doctor limit**: Line 116 had `doctor_links[:20]` which limited each speciality to only 20 doctors
2. **Single URL format**: Only tried the first URL format, breaking at line 68
3. **Basic pagination**: Limited pagination support
4. **Using wrong spider**: The enhanced `practo_doctors.py` spider was available but not being used by default

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed Artificial Limits âœ…
```python
# Before:
for href in doctor_links[:20]:  # Limit to first 20 doctors for testing

# After:
for href in doctor_links:  # Process all doctors found (removed artificial limit)
```

### 2. Enhanced URL Coverage âœ…
```python
# Before:
for search_url in [url, alt_url]:
    # ... yield request
    break  # Try only the first URL for now

# After:
for search_url in [url, alt_url]:
    # ... yield request
    # (removed break to try both URL formats)
```

### 3. Improved Pagination âœ…
- Added page number tracking
- Enhanced next page detection with multiple selectors
- Added fallback pagination URL construction
- Limited to 20 pages per speciality to prevent infinite loops

### 4. Better Logging âœ…
- Added progress counters
- Page number tracking in logs
- Total doctors found reporting

## Expected Results

| Metric | Before Fix | After Fix |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Doctors per speciality | 20 (artificial limit) | All available |
| Total specialities | 37 | 37 (unchanged) |
| URL formats tried | 1 | 2 |
| Pagination | Basic | Enhanced |
| **Total Bangalore doctors** | **~900** | **4000+** |

## How to Use

### Option 1: Simple Spider (Fixed) - HTTP Only
```bash
cd practo_scraper
python run_scraper.py --spider simple
```

### Option 2: Enhanced Spider - Requires Playwright
```bash
# Install Playwright browsers first
python -m playwright install chromium

# Run enhanced spider
cd practo_scraper
python run_scraper.py --spider enhanced
```

### Option 3: Test with Limited Items
```bash
# Test with only 100 items to verify fixes work
python run_scraper.py --spider simple --limit 100
```

## Verification

Run the validation test to confirm fixes:
```bash
python test_spider_fixes.py
```

Expected output should show:
- âœ… 37 specialities configured
- âœ… Artificial limits removed
- âœ… Enhanced pagination logic
- ðŸŽ¯ Expected result: 4000+ Bangalore doctors

## Current Data Status

The repository already contains data with **4370 Bangalore doctors** in `practo_scraper/bangalore_enhanced.csv`, suggesting previous enhancement efforts were successful. If you're still getting ~900 doctors, ensure you're:

1. Using the fixed spider (after applying these changes)
2. Not hitting any external rate limits
3. Using the correct speciality names that match Practo's format

## Troubleshooting

- **Still getting low results**: Check if Practo website structure changed
- **Timeout errors**: Increase `DOWNLOAD_DELAY` in settings.py  
- **Playwright errors**: Use simple spider or install browsers with `python -m playwright install chromium`
- **Network issues**: Add delays or use enhanced spider with better error handling

## Technical Details

### Spider Comparison
- **`practo_doctors_simple.py`**: Uses basic HTTP requests, simpler but limited
- **`practo_doctors.py`**: Uses Playwright for JavaScript rendering, more robust

### Configuration
- **Specialities**: 37 medical specialities (expanded from 19)
- **Cities**: Configured for Bangalore focus
- **Limits**: Removed artificial limits, added sensible pagination limits

The fix ensures comprehensive data collection while maintaining scraping ethics and avoiding infinite loops.
